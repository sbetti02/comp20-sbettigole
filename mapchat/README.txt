README file for assignment 2:



Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

I believe everything at this point has been correctly implemented.  I had a lot of difficulty getting the markers to work correctly and not always point to the last person on the list, but eventually figured it out with the this keyword.  The only thing that concerns me about the assignment is whether or not the distances are correct, because I don't know how to go about checking if they are exactly right or not.  Following the formula, my code would seem to work, but I am not perfectly sure.

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

I discussed issues I encountered on the assignment with Nick Sempere and Jon Arbaugh.

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

I spent roughly 12 hours on the assignment.
