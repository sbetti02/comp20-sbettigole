This Git repository was made for my Web Programming course, COMP 20, at Tufts University.  

My favorite work this semester was assignment 3, an assignment that brought everything we did together.  In the 2nd assignment, I created a map with the locations of myself and the other students in the class, with popups similar to status updates.  However, the information in the database was not hosted by me, but on a server built by Professor Ming.  That information was then plotted on a map I created from the google maps API.  In assignment 3, we actually made our own server for a message board for the map from assignment 2, on Heroku.  The map was altered so that we weren't pulling from the professor's server, but from our own.  I really enjoyed this because I had never started from nothing and built a complete, finished product accessible by anyone on the web.  All my other projects or work relied on someone else's work to be usable, or else it could not be run outside of an individual computer.  It felt great being able to play with the map and look through the web pages and know that the entire thing worked based on my own code.

I have grown a lot from the first day of this course to now.  Through the course, I strengthened some skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and learned several new tools that I had little or no knowledge of before (JQuery, NodeJS, MONGODB, API usage, responsive design, and others).  But beyond the practical skills obtained from this course, it reinspired my excitement for computer science.  Before college, I loved learning new things about how computers work and how to make my own stuff in my free time, but had slowly stopped exploring independently between work for my college courses.  I think I was always so concerned about the next assignment, lab, test, or project that I lost some of the enjoyment of programming, and instead was just doing work with the focus of completing the assignment.  This course encouraged more free thought and exploration than my previous two classes did, which was great for me.  Not to say that I wasn't still thinking about upcoming coursework, but I looked forward everyday to working on something for the class.  I started learning about non-coursework yet interesting things in my own free time again.  While away from classes for Thanksgiving, I found myself itching to program something new.  I decided to make a game, and I built pong, with both a 2-player and (following the end of the semester) a single-player mode with built in AI available.  I would say that this course reinspired my love of learning and computer science.

I think the most important thing I learned in this class was learning how to learn.  The class is based on learning through doing, and you need more than just what's shown in lecture or on the assignment page to complete your work.  I needed to get better at figuring things out on my own.  In one example, I needed to learn how to use the SpotifyWeb API in order to add a feature to my group project, a project we worked on throughout the semester.  Understanding how to use resources on the web and knowing how to implement them in our own code was essential to adding the feature.  At another point, I encountered several issues on assignment 2, making the mapchat map functional.  I needed to look up many things and be able to apply them efficiently to my own work.  Through these assignments, I developed skills in learning how to be able to figure things out on my own without needing to rely on other people.  

I would like to learn more about mobile development after the completion of this course.  I think it would be really exciting and fun to make my own mobile applications.
