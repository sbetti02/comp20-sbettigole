README for lab 7

The actual logging works correctly, and as of this writing I have fixed the local storage issues I had.  I also added code to make sure that the seconds/minutes/hours always appear normally (instead of a time listed as 11:4:3).  I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab.  I have spent about 4 hours on this assignment.
